Welcome to spring-myBatis!
===================


A barebones MyBatis Example project on eclipse. Just import the entire directory in Eclipse and you are ready to go.

----------
In addition, a MySQL Workbench file is included, along with a sample MyBatis generator file. You can use these to explore more complex mappings - for example, to use the generator with an existing schema.

This example uses an embedded H2 database by default. This allows you to check the project out and immediately run a clean build via Maven:

# mvn clean verify
